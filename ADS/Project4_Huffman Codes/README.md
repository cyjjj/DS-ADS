# 8-1 Huffman Codes (20 分)

@ In 1953, David A. Huffman published his paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes", and hence printed his name in the history of computer science. As a professor who gives the final exam problem on Huffman codes, I am encountering a big problem: the Huffman codes are NOT unique. For example, given a string "aaaxuaxz", we can observe that the frequencies of the characters 'a', 'x', 'u' and 'z' are 4, 2, 1 and 1, respectively. We may either encode the symbols as {'a'=0, 'x'=10, 'u'=110, 'z'=111}, or in another way as {'a'=1, 'x'=01, 'u'=001, 'z'=000}, both compress the string into 14 bits. Another set of code can be given as {'a'=0, 'x'=11, 'u'=100, 'z'=101}, but {'a'=0, 'x'=01, 'u'=011, 'z'=001} is NOT correct since "aaaxuaxz" and "aazuaxax" can both be decoded from the code 00001011001001. The students are submitting all kinds of codes, and I need a computer program to help me determine which ones are correct and which ones are not.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an integer *N* (2≤*N*≤63), then followed by a line that contains all the *N* distinct characters and their frequencies in the following format:



```
c[1] f[1] c[2] f[2] ... c[N] f[N]
```

where `c[i]` is a character chosen from {'0' - '9', 'a' - 'z', 'A' - 'Z', '_'}, and `f[i]` is the frequency of `c[i]` and is an integer no more than 1000. The next line gives a positive integer *M* (≤1000), then followed by *M* student submissions. Each student submission consists of *N* lines, each in the format:

```
c[i] code[i]
```

where `c[i]` is the `i`-th character and `code[i]` is an non-empty string of no more than 63 '0's and '1's.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in each line either "Yes" if the student's submission is correct, or "No" if not.

Note: The optimal solution is not necessarily generated by Huffman algorithm. Any prefix code with code length being optimal is considered correct.

### Grading Policy:

**Programming:** Write the program (10 pts.) **with sufficient comments**.

**Testing:** Provide a set of test cases to fill in a test report (3 pts.). Write analysis and comments (3 pts.).

**Documentation:** Chapter 1 (1 pt.), Chapter 2 (2 pts.), and finally a complete report (1 point for overall style of documentation).
